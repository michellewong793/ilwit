I love women in tech project

## Motivation
A lot of times in life, we gotta be our own hypewoman. I wanted to try building something that would allow me to type and save encouraging words to myself. 
It's also just very fun to populate things on a page. 
This is a very barebones version of the project, without any database, and is just mostly a first effort at getting a project together. 

## Technologies used (and plan to use)
React.js, Next.js, GraphQL, Postgres for database 
CSS fun 

## To run the project: 
Go to root directory. 
1. Install node_modules with ```yarn```
2. Build the project ```yarn build```
3. Follow commands to serve the project and check out the app! 

## Features I'm thinking about
Feature 1: Save notes
I need to:  
-[] Add postgres database to keep track of Notes added 
-[] Use GraphQL as well 
-[] Use Next.js API routes  

## Future feature ideas: 
-Scramble and animate on button press
